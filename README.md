# SPEAR 
To reproduce the performance reported in the paper, you can run following the bash file:

bash install.sh

bash run.sh [--device_id=]

- if you want to run the code on a specific device, you can specify the device id by adding the argument `--device_id=`

- if you want to specify the device for a specific task,you should modify the device_id in the `run.sh` file.
